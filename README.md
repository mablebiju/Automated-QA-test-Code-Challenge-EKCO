This my solutions for the two code test challenges for submission on 6/11/2023 - (Monday)

My Approach - 

API Testing.
In this project, I embarked on the journey of API testing using Playwright, a framework I hadn't previously worked with. To get started, I dove into the fundamentals of Playwright and attempted to conduct tests in the online Playwright code editor. Unfortunately, I encountered an error - 'request.post ECONNREFUSED,' which I struggled to resolve. As a result, I switched to Visual Studio Code and leveraged JavaScript, incorporating two crucial libraries/packages. The 'expect' function, sourced from the "@playwright/test" package, is a widely recognized assertion library that's closely associated with Playwright. It played a pivotal role in defining and validating expectations during the testing process. Additionally, I made use of the 'request' object from the "supertest" package, a highly-regarded library tailored for making HTTP requests, specifically tailored for API testing. This library simplifies the process of sending HTTP requests (such as GET, POST, DELETE) to a server and receiving responses, making it an invaluable asset for API testing scenarios. I meticulously performed all assertions and meticulously verified each one. For reference, I have attached screenshots showcasing the process.

Front-End Testing.
